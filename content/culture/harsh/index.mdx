something **noise** and a little `random()`

<h2>Hello, Venus!</h2>
<h2>Hello, Mars!</h2>

<h1>Heading!</h1>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a lovely language.

And here is *markdown* in **JSX**!

Two 🍰 is: {Math.PI * 2}


{(function () {
  const guess = Math.random()

  if (guess > 0.66) {
    return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
  }

  if (guess > 0.33) {
    return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
  }

  return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}


<div># this is not a heading but *this* is emphasis</div>
